# Fiftyville: Mystery of the Stolen Duck
## Problem Overview
In this project, I was tasked with solving the mystery of the stolen CS50 Duck in the town of Fiftyville. The authorities believe the thief took the duck and escaped with the help of an accomplice. The theft took place on July 28, 2024, on Humphrey Street. Using an SQLite database (fiftyville.db), I queried the data to identify:

* The thief
* The city the thief escaped to
* The accomplice who helped the thief escape
Approach
* I used SQL queries to explore the provided database, searching for clues about the thief, the escape city, and the accomplice. Each query was carefully crafted to extract the necessary information from various tables in the database. I documented all queries in log.sql, and my final conclusions were recorded in answers.txt.

## Files Included
* log.sql: A log of all SQL queries run during the investigation, including comments explaining my reasoning and approach.
* answers.txt: The final answers to the mystery, including the thief's name, the escape city, and the accomplice's name.
## Tools Used
SQLite
SQL queries
## Goal
The objective was to leverage SQL to query and analyze data to solve a real-life mystery using the provided town records.
