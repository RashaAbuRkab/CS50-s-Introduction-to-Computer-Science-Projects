If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
+------------+-------------+------------------+
| avg_energy | avg_valence | avg_danceability |
+------------+-------------+------------------+
| 0.65906    | 0.484443    | 0.71646          |
+------------+-------------+------------------+
Given these values, you might describe the listener’s audio aura as "Energetic and Rhythmic with a Balanced Emotional Tone."
This combination reflects someone who enjoys active, danceable music but doesn't lean too strongly toward either happy or sad music.

Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura mightnot be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

* Temporal Bias: This aura might not fully represent the listener's overall music preferences because it reflects only their top 100 songs from one year.
The user may enjoy different moods or genres at other times, which this snapshot misses.

* Narrow Focus on Attributes: Only considering energy, valence, and danceability limits the understanding of the listener's true musical diversity.
Other attributes like tempo or acousticness might change the interpretation.
