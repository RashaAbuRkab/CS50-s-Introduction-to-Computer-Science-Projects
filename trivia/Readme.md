# Trivia: Trivia Question Webpage
## Problem Overview
In this project, I created a webpage that allows users to answer trivia questions. The trivia game consists of multiple-choice questions as well as text-based free response questions. Each question has logic that provides feedback to the user based on whether their answer is correct or incorrect.

## Features
- Multiple-Choice Trivia Questions:

* The user can select one of the multiple answer choices.
* If the user selects the correct answer, the button turns green with a “Correct!” message.
* If the user selects the incorrect answer, the button turns red with an “Incorrect” message.

- Free Response Trivia Questions:

* The user types a response and clicks a button to confirm their answer.
* If the answer is correct, the input field turns green with a “Correct!” message.
* If the answer is incorrect, the input field turns red with an “Incorrect” message.

## Implementation

CSS: Styled the page to make it visually appealing.

JavaScript: Implemented the logic for checking the answers, providing feedback, and changing the color of the buttons or input field based on the user's response.
Files Included

styles.css: Provides styling to the webpage to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Goal
